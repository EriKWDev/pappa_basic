<h1>Basic as internal language for the camera</h1>

<h2>Why Basic</h2>
When deciding which language to put in the camera we were considering
a lot of different languages. Selecting Basic may sound quite strange,
but after looking into various possiblibities this was the choice. Of
course all the code for the camera is written in C++ and C.
<p>
We were considering the following langueges:
<ul>
<li><b>'C'</b>. This is far too complex to make an embedded compiler for.
<li><b>perl</b>. Perl with it's dynamic and extremly flexible syntax would
have made it idea - especially since it is common for CGI:scripts. But for
this camera it simply wouldn't make it.
<li><b>'TCL'</b>. This language is not well spread enough and it is not easy
enough to learn for a beginner.
<li><b>'Proprietary script'</b>. This was really the option, but writing a
basic interpreter is much more generic. It is also quite common in industrial
and measurment applications still today.
</ul>
The advantages of Basic is it's ease of writing (and extending) the interpreter.
We based it on an old interpreter that I had written in 1982, converted that
over to C, and the first version was running the very same day in C!. Then
we extended the basic with labels, to get rid of the line-numbers in goto,
gosub e t c (yes, you can still use them, but you get a warning!).


<h2>Internal file format</h2>
The internal fileformat is defined with the following tokens:
<ul>
<li><b>0x32</b> Two byte integer. Internally it calculates with 32 bit variables, but to save memory space it may be stored as 2 bytes only.
<li><b>0x34</b> Four byte integer. Internally it calculates with 32 bit variables, but to save memory space it may be stored as 2 bytes only.
<li><b>0x0a</b> End of Line delimiter.
<li><b>0x41-0x58</b> Integer variable.
<li><b>0x61-0x78</b> String variable.
<li><b>0x80-0xff</b> Token for "something". See
<a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/words">here</a> for which tokens we have.
These tokens are compiled by the
<a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/fixcom.pl">fixcom.pl perl script</a> into the
two files
<a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/commands.h"> commands.h</a> and
<a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/codes.h">codes.h</a> which define all the
tokens.
</ul>
<h2>Source code of the basic:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/mgmon.c">The interface to the basic.</a>
Contains MG monitor, which is interface to the basic.
<li><a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/basic.c">Runtime of the basic.</a>
 Contains the run module, as well as the string handling, 'list', 'run' command
decode.
<li><a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/expr.c">Integer Expression analyzer</a>. This analyzes a mathematical expression and returns it's value. Only available for
integers (32 bit), but can easily be made for float as well. Simple form, the
drawback is that it generates minimum 5 procedure calls and for a simple
addition 5 + 5 calls.
<li><a href = "/~martin/cprog/basic/compline.c"> This is the compile one line
block</a>, which also list one line.
</ul>
More to come....
